* `Atomicity` —> in a transaction, all operations will complete or none will be completed (rollback)
* `Consistency` —> the database will be in a consistent state during the start and end of a transaction and cannot leave the state in between
* `Isolation` —> there will be no interference among the concurrent transactions
* `Durability` —> once a transaction commits, it will remain so even after the server restarts or fails
